# Readme

This project corresponds to the paper **"A Two-Stage Profit Allocation Method for Virtual Power Plants Considering Uncertainties"**. This repository provides partial code and interface structures for our research project. It aims to:

- Show the core implementation structure.
- Help reviewers or interested researchers understand or partially reproduce the results;
- Serve as a basis for full open-sourcing in the future.
